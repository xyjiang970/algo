# 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring (a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string) without repeating characters.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Base 
        if len(s) <= 1:
            return len(s)

        # `left` pointer is start of current substring.
        # `maxSub` stores length of the longest substring so far.
        # `seen` is a set which allows us to store "seen" characters.
        left, maxSub, seen = 0, 0, set()

        # we iterate the `right` pointer
        for right in range(len(s)):
            
            # In each iteration, check if character in current 
            # position is already in the `seen` set.

            # If the character is already in `seen`, remove
            # the characters from `seen` set starting from left 
            # end of current substring until the duplicate 
            # character is removed.
            while s[right] in seen:
                seen.remove(s[left])
                # Update left pointer to next position.
                left += 1
            
            # Add current character to `seen` set
            # and update maxSub variable to maximum length
            # found so far (which is the difference between
            # the current position (right) and the start
            # position (left) plus 1).
            seen.add(s[right])
            maxSub = max(maxSub, (right - left) + 1)
        return maxSub
```

* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Auxiliary Space/ Memory: O(n) or O(k) where k is the number of characters added to set().
