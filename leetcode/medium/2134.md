# 2134: Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II

A **swap** is defined as taking two **distinct** positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

A **circular** array is defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent.

Given a **binary circular** array `nums`, return the _minimum number of swaps required to group all `1`'s present in the array together at **any location**_.

```python
class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
	# totalOnes is the number of 1's present in array.
        totalOnes = sum(nums)
		
	# onesInCurrWindow is the count of 1's in the current window.
        onesInCurrWindow = sum(nums[:totalOnes])
        
	# Count the maximum number of 1's in any window of size totalOnes.
        maxOnesInWindow = float('-inf')
		
        # Move the array with a constant window size of totalOnes
        for i in range(totalOnes, len(nums) + totalOnes):
	    # In this step we are moving window forward by one step
            # if nums[i%n] is 1 then add 1 to onesInCurrWindow
            # if nums[i - totalOnes] is 1 then subtrct 1 from onesInCurrWindow.
            onesInCurrWindow += (nums[i % len(nums)] - nums[i - totalOnes])
            maxOnesInWindow = max(maxOnesInWindow, onesInCurrWindow)
            
        return totalOnes - maxOnesInWindow
