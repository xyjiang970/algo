# 278: First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        start, end = 0, n
        mid = 0

        while start < end:
            mid = (start+end) // 2

            # if True, ignore right half
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                end = mid

            # ignore left half since:
            else:
                start = mid+1

        return start
```

* Time Complexity: O(log n)
* Auxiliary Space/ Memory: O(1)
