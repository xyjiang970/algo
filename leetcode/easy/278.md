# 278: First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        # If there is just one bad version.
        if n == 1 and isBadVersion(n):
            return 1

        # right = n because we are starting with index 1.
        l, r, mid = 0, n, 0

        while l <= r:
            # Keep finding the middle.
            mid = (l+r)//2

            # If bad version is not found, new left
            # is now middle version + 1.
            if isBadVersion(mid) == False:
                l = mid+1
            
            # Otherwise if bad version IS FOUND,
            # new right is middle version - 1 
            # because we want to find the FIRST
            # bad version. 
            else:
                r = mid-1
        
        # Return the FIRST bad version
        return l
```
